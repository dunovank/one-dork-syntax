## oceans16-syntax theme for Atom

A more saturated take on the spacegray ocean scheme. However, for the ultimate saturation experience you'll probably want to go with [oceans16-bright](https://github.com/dunovank/oceans16-bright-syntax). And when you need a break from the dark themes, try a little [3rd grade nostalgia](https://github.com/dunovank/grade3-syntax)

If you're feeling it, go dress up your IPython (Jupyter) Notebooks [here](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes).
